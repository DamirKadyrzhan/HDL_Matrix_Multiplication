# Matrix Processing Core Design 

This project is focused on developing the specialised hardware to handle large complex operations. The aim is to make a synthesisable matrix processing core capable to handle 32x32 operations using buffers. 

The buffers acts as a separate IP cores that handle data and calculations.
